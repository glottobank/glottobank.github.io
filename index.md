<p class="lead">
Glottobank is an international research consortium established to document and 
understand the world’s linguistic diversity. Glottobank team members are 
pursuing this goal on two fronts. First, we have established four global 
databases documenting variation in language structure (Grambank), 
lexicon (Lexibank), paradigm systems (Parabank) and phonetic changes (Phonobank). 
In doing so, we seek to develop new methods in language documentation, compile 
data on the world’s languages and make this data accessible and useful. Second, 
we are developing methods to use this data to make inferences about human 
prehistory, relationships between languages and processes of language change.

### Grambank

Grambank is a database of structural (typological) features of language. It 
consists of 200 logically independent features (most of them binary) spanning 
all subdomains of morphosyntax. The Grambank feature questionnaire has been 
filled in, based on reference grammars, for over 500 languages. The aim is to 
eventually reach as many as 3,000 languages. The database can be used to 
investigate language prehistory, the geographical-distribution of 
features, language universals and the functional interaction of structural 
features.

### Lexibank

Lexibank is a public database and repository for lexical data from the languages of the 
world. Currently, Lexibank contains lexemes and cognate judgments from ~2500 languages 
spanning Africa, Europe, Asia, the Pacific, and the Americas. The database will be used to 
refine cognate judgments, infer language relationships, construct language phylogenies, 
test hypotheses about language history, investigate factors that affect the mode and 
tempo of language evolution, model sound change, and facilitate quantitative comparisons 
with other types of linguistic data. The initial focus of Lexibank will be on compiling 
basic or core vocabulary, but ultimately the database will be expanded to include a full 
range of lexicon from all the world’s languages.

website.

### Parabank

Parabank is a large database of selected paradigmatic structures found in the world’s 
languages, focusing on the patterning of formal similarities and identities (or 
*syncretisms*) between cells in these paradigms (cf  *I* vs *me* but *you* vs *you*). It is 
motivated by the observation that different languages and language families have 
significantly different patterns in their syncretisms and that at least some of these are 
stable through time. In addition, information arranged in matrices gains additional power 
because of the large number of values that can be calculated by comparing every cell with 
every other cell.  

Because the paradigms we explore are ubiquitous across the world’s languages, our working 
hypothesis is that paradigmatic syncretisms can provide significant signal to linguistic 
relationships in time, and the database is designed to allow the systematic 
exploration of morphosyntactic features by linguistic typologists and evolutionary 
biologists. Additionally, Parabank will be an important resource to assist in the 
identification and quantification of some of the important mechanisms in how the design 
space of language evolves. Initially, the database will assemble paradigms of free 
pronouns, verb agreement, and a subset of kin terms, with subsequent plans to incorporate 
demonstratives/interrogatives/indefinite pronouns/negative pronouns, numeral systems, and 
other promising linguistic subsystems with paradigmatic structure.

Parabank will be led by Nick Evans, Simon Greenhill and Kyla Quinn, all based at the 
Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language (CoEDL), at 
the Australian National University (ANU), but welcomes the participation of any interested 
researcher. Funding will primarily come from the CoEDL.

### Phonobank

Phonobank aims to establish a cross-linguistic comparative database of sound patterns, 
sound correspondences, and sound shifts. Our starting point is collections of multiple 
phonetic alignments of cognate sets in language families. All sounds are linked to a 
cross-linguistic phonetic alphabet that provides distinctive features and segment 
descriptions. The ultimate goals of the database are to support the computational 
linguistic comparison of word forms and to serve as a basis for improving the methods of 
computer assisted cognate detection, sound reconstruction and building linguistic 
phylogenies from sound correspondences.


### Methods and Tools

The Glottobank team is developing a suite of methods and tools for analysing comparative 
linguistic data. For example, using the [BEAST 2](http://www.beast2.org) software 
platform, we have created a Bayesian framework for 
[phylogeographic inference of language expansion in space and time](http://language.cs.auckland.ac.nz/). 
[BEASTling](https://github.com/lmaurits/BEASTling) is a program designed
to help linguists easily prepare Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of
linguistic data using the BEAST 2 platform.  It automates many tedious
data-preparation tasks, features close integration with the
[Glottolog language catalog](http://glottolog.org), and strives to follow established best 
practices for computational linguistic phylogenetics. 
[LingPy](http://lingpy.org) is a Python library for quantitative tasks in historical 
linguistics. It offers state-of-the-art algorithms for pairwise and multiple phonetic 
alignment analyses, automatic cognate detection, and various tools to explore and curate 
lexical data. Finally, [CLDF](https://github.com/glottobank/cldf) and associated standards 
are aimed at providing an interface between databases and tools which will enable easier 
sharing of data and code.


### Funding

In addition to the time and energy of members of the consortium, Glottobank is supported 
by the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, 
a Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Grant (grant #13-UOA-121) and 
the ARC Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language.
